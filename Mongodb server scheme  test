i. Mongo has got a DB for testing purpose i.e test by default.
ii.So to test it we have our mongo.exe i.e. mongo shell waiting for our input.
iii. We’ll start by inserting in our test db
db.test.save({TestField :’ White House’})
where test is the db and save is the insert command , TestField is the column name and WhiteHouse is the value of it.
